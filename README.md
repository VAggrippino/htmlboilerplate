# HTML Boilerplate
I love the work done by the team that created the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/), but it's just too robust for my needs.

So, this is just what I need. It's just the basic HTML and CSS I need to save me from the copy and paste routine whenever I start a new project.

I'm sure I'll add to it over time. I might even get some ideas from the HTML5 Boilerplate project, but this will always be intended specifically for my projects and will never be as big as HTML5 Boilerplate.
